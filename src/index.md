## About Me

I'm Elad, a programmer nearly since birth (I could code basic stuff in qBasic even before I could read and write).

I am a quick learner and very good at adapting to new technologies and platforms, I am  I'm meticulous and obsessive about user interface design and experience, and I excel at solving real-world problems and fixing issues with both software and hardware.

I am currently employed as a Senior Software Engineer at [GE Healthcare](https://www.gehealthcare.com/) in the Cybersecurity and Software Infrastructure team.

I am also a hard-core Trekkie and a big fan of space exploration and astronomy, having also previously volunteered at [SpaceIL](https://www.spaceil.com/) as a science educator.
