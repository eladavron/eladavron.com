# About Me

I'm Elad Avron, a passionate developer with a love for building elegant, efficient solutions to complex problems.

- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, modern frameworks and static site generators
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git, Linux, CI/CD pipelines
- **Practices**: Clean code, testing, documentation, open source contribution

## Philosophy

I believe that great software comes from a combination of:

- Never stopping learning

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.
